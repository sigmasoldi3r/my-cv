# My personal CV

Want to have an idea of how this document was generated?

Take a look into [cv.js](/render/cv.js), there is where the magic happens.

\*Note: If you happen to have [Tobermory's ES6 String HTML][es6-str] (Or similar) for VSCode,
you'll see the code with more colors, the fragments will be shown as HTML. (If not,
github renders it nicely anyway!).
